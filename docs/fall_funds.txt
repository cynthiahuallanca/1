(please expand post for additional information)

Each year, classes pool together funds to cover several group activities and special school events, as well as gifts for our educators and staff.  This enables us to operate efficiently and effectively to ensure our scholars have fun while learning throughout the year.  For Mrs. Garcia‚Äôs class, we are asking each scholar to contribute $45 to $55 per semester.  The contribution itself is not mandatory and the amount is a suggested range ‚Äì you may contribute more or less. 

We endeavor to be transparent in the use of these funds, so will be maintaining a list of all donations, records and receipts for all expenditures, and a working budget.  Where appropriate/possible we will consult with parents prior to making any major decisions on behalf of the class.  We will also aim to reduce costs through additional donations, help from volunteers, collaborations with other classes, reaching out to the community and local organizations for discounts and donations for class activities, and reusing/recycling. 

Fall contributions will cover:
-       Historical Festival ‚Äì class and trunk-or-treat decorations, lunch, and a fun craft activity
-       Thanksgiving Party ‚Äì class decorations and a fun craft activity
-       Holiday Hot Cocoa Party ‚Äì class decorations, lunch, and a fun craft activity
-       Holiday Gifts ‚Äì We will be providing a cash gift of $350 and small gift basket for Mrs. Garcia, as well as contributing $125 from our class to be combined with contributions from other classes to provide gifts for specials (physical education, art, and music), specialists (ESE, psychologist, and reading interventionist), administration and office support, and security, maintenance, and janitorial.
